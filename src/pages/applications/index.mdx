<PageDescription>

Move your existing application towards a more cloud-native model built on a modern cloud platform.

</PageDescription>

## Overview

Application modernization is a journey of moving existing applications to a more modern cloud-native infrastructure.
A high level overview of key application modernization concepts is available in the [Application Modernization Field Guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/field-guide/app-modernization-field-guide/) and the IBM Architecture Center [Application Modernization reference architecture](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/application-modernization/)


## Solutions

Reference implementations for several approaches to application modernization are provided that can be suited towards approaching your own implementation.

### Runtime modernization
Updating the application runtime to a suitable cloud-native framework (Liberty) and deploying in Red Hat OpenShift. This solution shows different deployment options including using modern CI/CD tools (Tekton & ArgoCD) and using heritage CI/CD tools (Jenkins)
* [Walk through code](./liberty/README.mdx) 
* [Get the code]() on GitHub
* [View solution]() at IBM Cloud Architecture Center

### Spring Framework modernization
* [Spring modernization](./spring/README.md) -- Updated a prior Spring application by updating to the latest Spring Boot and deploying in Red Hat OpenShift

### Operational modernization with Heritage CI/CD tools
* [Operation modernization](./was90/README.md) -- Repackaging the application to deploy within a container but maintaining a monolith application without changes to the application or runtime
