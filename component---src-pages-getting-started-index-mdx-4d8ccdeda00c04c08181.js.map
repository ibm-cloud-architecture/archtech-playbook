It`}{`’`}{`s odd that something so prevalent in the industry has been defined so variously, but part of that is due to the fact that the nature of applications have changed so much over the past fifty or so years of commercial application development.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let`}{`’`}{`s start by saying I don`}{`’`}{`t mean that an application is `}{`”`}{`just a program`}{`”`}{`. That may have been true of some systems thirty years ago, but it`}{`’`}{`s certainly not true of most enterprise systems today. As developers we like to think of `}{`”`}{`the application`}{`”`}{` as being our Java EAR files or WAR files, but that`}{`’`}{`s only a small part of what the entire application actually consists of.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Instead, an application as I define it consists of one (but usually more) custom-written program components together with the supporting infrastructure, application middleware, middleware services (such as databases, queuing software, integration software and other aspects) and other components that make up a complete solution. It probably is deployed over several computers, either for scalability horizontally (the same component deployed multiple times) or vertically (the solution is split into multiple coordinating components). It may split itself across multiple geographical regions, or across multiple operating systems or computing architectures.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When you draw out all of these components, their dependencies, and the different systems that those all depend on and communicate with, what you end up is rarely the nice, neat, tree-like structure you see pictured in software engineering textbooks.

As a result, any change almost never happens all at once - this is an effort that takes not only planning, but time to execute.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`Why modernize?

You may be interested in it for a purely mercenary reason - because there`}{`’`}{`s a new technology you want to put on your resume. You may do it because a vendor tells you it`}{`’`}{`s the right thing to do (or worse, that it`}{`’`}{`s fast and easy!) None of these are good reasons for going down the long modernization road. However, there are three things that we have seen that are good reasons for beginning the journey:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`You can`}{`’`}{`t develop features at the pace your business requires - and it`}{`’`}{`s the technology choices and architecture (and not your processes or team constraints) that is causing that.`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`The architecture of your application is hindering you from being able to add functionality because of fragility (you can`}{`’`}{`t test it) or constraints arising from technology choices.`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Your application is expensive to maintain and extend because either the infrastructure is excessively costly (for instance, older versions of middleware that require special support contracts) or the skills required are too expensive to find and maintain.`}</p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`If you are in any of these situations, then application modernization may be a good match for you. Once you`}{`’`}{`ve made the decision to start in the right direction, the next question is how you keep moving in that direction.`}</p>\n    <h1>{`How do you succeed? Follow the proven path`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Before we look at the modernization journey, let`}{`’`}{`s consider the application current state. The key here is that there will be some applications that will NEVER leave their current state. There are several reasons why this would be true.`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The application may have a limited lifetime. If you are going to retire an application, then there is no need to modernize it.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The application may be replaceable by SaaS. If the application (at least in its current form) can be entirely replaced by a SaaS application, then in many cases that is the simplest and easiest route.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The application may be one that is supported by a vendor or third party ISV that is resistant or even hostile to changing their implementation, automation or management. If that is true, then that should be a reason to start looking for other alternatives (SaaS or other…)`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`We would hope that the number of applications that fall into this category are small, but realistically, the number can be large. For companies that consider themselves to be `}{`”`}{`technology companies`}{`”`}{` this figure may be in the low double digits, perhaps 20-30%. However, for companies that explicitly do not consider IT to be part of their business competency (as often evidenced by large outsourcing contracts and wide reliance on packaged software) the number can be quite large - we have seen up to 80% in some companies that are part of mature industries. When costs savings becomes the driving force in IT and completely subsumes innovation, then this end state is nearly inevitable. When that is true, that may be an indication that this particular company, or perhaps the entire industry, is ripe for disruption.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let`}{`’`}{`s take a look at the high level map of our modernization journey:`}</p>\n    <span {...{\n      \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\",\n        \"display\": \"block\",\n        \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n        \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n        \"maxWidth\": \"974px\"\n      }\n    }}>{`\n      `}<span parentName=\"span\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"paddingBottom\": \"45.138888888888886%\",\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"bottom\": \"0\",\n          \"left\": \"0\",\n          \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n          \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n          \"display\": \"block\"\n        }\n      }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"span\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n        \"alt\": \"journey\",\n        \"title\": \"journey\",\n        \"src\": \"/archtech-playbook/static/c611738640a3998bd543c7f6b90b422c/3df5d/journey.png\",\n        \"srcSet\": [\"/archtech-playbook/static/c611738640a3998bd543c7f6b90b422c/7fc1e/journey.png 288w\", \"/archtech-playbook/static/c611738640a3998bd543c7f6b90b422c/a5df1/journey.png 576w\", \"/archtech-playbook/static/c611738640a3998bd543c7f6b90b422c/3df5d/journey.png 974w\"],\n        \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"width\": \"100%\",\n          \"height\": \"100%\",\n          \"margin\": \"0\",\n          \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n          \"position\": \"absolute\",\n          \"top\": \"0\",\n          \"left\": \"0\"\n        },\n        \"loading\": \"lazy\"\n      }}></img>{`\n    `}</span>\n    <p>{`The first part is Discovery and Assessment phase that consists of 3 steps described below.
